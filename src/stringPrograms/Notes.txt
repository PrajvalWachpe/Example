String is a final predefined class.
String objects are used to store sequence of character.

since string is final class we will not able to extend any class to this string class.

String literals create objects in SCP(String Constant Poll)
When we store data in string object each character is given an index starting from 0 to length()-1
String is class so it has many methods in it. Most commonly used methods are:-

1]length() :- this method give total number of character in string.

2]charAt(index) :-  this method give character present at given index.

3]toUpperCase() :- this method return a new string object in which all letters are capital

4]toLowerCase() :- this method return a new string object in which all letters are small

5].contains :- this method return true if it finds the given word in our string otherwise returns false.

6].replace(OldCharacter, NewCharacter):- This method returns a new string in which all old character is replaced by new character.

7] .replace("String1", "String2"):- This method returns a new String in which all old string1 is replaced by new string2.

8] .replace("String1", "String2"):- this methods return new string where only first occurrence of string 1 is replaced by 
new string 2

9] .indexOf ():- this method returns index of first occurrence of given character
10] .lastIndexof ():- this method returns index of last occurrence of given character

11] .indexOf ("String"):- this method returns index of first occurrence of given string

12] .indexOf ('character', StartIndex):- this method returns index of first occurrence of given character starting the search from given
startIndex

13].indexOf ("String", StartIndex ):- this method returns index of first occurrence of given string starting the search from given
startIndex

14] .subString():- this method has return a new string there are all character of original string starting from the given index.

15] .subString(StartIndex, OffSetindex):-  this method has return a new string there are all character of original string starting 
from the given start index up to off set index.
Note:We will not see character present in off set index

16] . startsWith(word):- will give true if the string start with the  given word
17] .endWith(word):-will give true if the string end with the  given word

19] .ConCat(): create new object with all the new character attached to original value


String is immutable:- It's original object can't change be changed. If we call
