Difference between Comparable and Comparator -

1)  Comparable is implemented directly on Pojo class.
	Comparator is implemented on separate class.
	
2)  Comparable allows you to compare object bases on any single property only.
	Comparator allows you to compare objects in different ways.

3)  Comparable is in java.lang package.
	Comparator is in java.util.package.

4)  Comparable has abstract method compareTo(Object ob);
	Comparator has abstract method compare(Object o1, Object o2);

5)  When using Comparable, We sort by Collections.sort(listName);
	When using Comparator, We sort by Collections.sort(listName, Comparator implemented object);
