Packages are used to group similar classes, interfaces and enums together.

Uses Of PAckage:-
1] Naming Convenience:- We can make class with same name in different packages.
Hence we are able to use same name again and again.

2] packages provide protection to the classes and interfaces because the access specifiers
work on basis  of packages.
Example:- Default methods or variable will not be visible from any class present outside 
the packages.

3] Code reusability:- If we want to use code of class from some other packages we have to option of importing
that class in our program. 

4] Easy to find classes and interfaces as we can know which classes are stored in which packages

sub packages:- these are packages made inside another packages.
